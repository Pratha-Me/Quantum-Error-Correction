# Quantum-Error-Correction

In this notebook I performed a simple 3-qubit bit flip QEC. I hope my work will help you introduce to QEC. It shows all the procedures step by step, in particular order of, encoding, random noise, syndrome measurement, error correction and decoding. The primary references I followed to produce this notebook is enlisted at the end. The notebooks last section provides the additional references for further studies. This pdf file for the primary reference is present in the assets folder. :)
