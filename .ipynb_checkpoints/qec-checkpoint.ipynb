    "## Qunatum Error Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important aspects in Quantum computation/information is send the encoded data from start to end. Up until now, no one can guarantee you the data intregity. It's a phenomenon plagued due to decoherence. The qunatum state is contingent to it's surrounding. Unless it's mitigated the quantum superiority would be a far fetched idea. At least on the state of the art Quantum computers phrased as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, QEC is explored and mitigated for three qubit system. First attention would be towards the bit-flip and next would be sign-flip. A quantum error correction consists of four major steps: encoding, error detection, error recovery, and decoding. "
